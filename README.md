**Introduction**

Lucky Casino is a memory game using cards and the users are required to match pairs via the same picture. This website will use the user&#39;s memory and skill in trying to match the pairs before the time runs out. The website can be used by everyone and will be fun and challenging for everybody who has an attempt. The site will be bright, colorful and will have a host of interactive content. This will include animations, music, sounds and high JavaScript content involved to improve the site functionality.

- Fun game matching the pairs of cards together
- Interactive content to make the game more appealing and fun to the user making the first impression on the user greater.
- This will test the user&#39;s skill and memory attributes offering a challenge for the user to haver another go to try and complete the game.

**UX**

different items that could be used for pictures. I wanted the page to be interactive and also provide the actions of a casino such e.g. dice rolling, chips rolling, happy music and certain font that would suit the game theme.

### User Stories

As an older player seeking to strengthen my memory I want:

- to have a game that&#39;s not themed for children
- to start the game without any delay once the user is ready
- to play another round easily
- As a player I want the game to work correctly. The functionality of the game should be flipping the cards and revealing the images behind them.
- to be acoustically rewarded if I have a match
- to see the animation of the pairs I have matched on the cards. This will be a left to right smooth motion for each image.
- to hear the music playing when the game start
- to hear the victory music to indicate I have won the game.
- to hear the fail music if I time out.
- don&#39;t want any errors while playing the game
- the timer to countdown giving the sense of a challenge to try and complete the game
- to be aware of how many flips it took me to win the game
- to be able to mute the sound and unmute the sound via a button.
- to see casino like animages (poker chip and dice images on the card backs rotate)
- to know where the cursor is hovering over the card selected (dice move to center of card)

**Design**

**Inspiration:**

The design was influenced by the original idea as a casino I believed the aspects, items and general first thought what a casino was is too be applied. If people walk into a casino they think of cards, money and various symbols such as chips, bells, cherry&#39;s etc. I have attempted to include the same feel from an actual casino to make it more appealing that they are at one when viewing the design of the game. I looked at various pictures and from experience know what is in a casino. It is normally associated with fun therefore I believed the idea would good for a memory games due to the various different items that could be used for pictures. I wanted the page to be interactive and also provide the actions of a casino such e.g. dice rolling, chips rolling, happy music and certain font that would suit the game theme.

**Font**

The font used for the game was from [www.dafont.com](http://www.dafont.com/) it was perfect and suited for the theme of the game. I had tried several fonts amending the styles of the size and colour which wasn&#39;t suited. The website provided me a font that I thought would suit well on the website. It had the style that I was looking for and gave the font a better design overall on the webpage. Examples have been provided below.

**Colours**

The colours used for this game/website are casino based. Using the green, red and gold related colours with black to represent the night. The default colours used for chips, gambling tables and playing cards was the influence. I could have used any colours but don&#39;t believe it would suit the need. Also, I tried and tested various colours and it didn&#39;t fit very well. This provided me with the idea to keep it with the topic the game is under. When people join or view the game/webpage they&#39;ll feel like it&#39;s a casino from the beginning. The colours used are have been displayed below.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_a2412158b747fa2f.png) ![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_2bd46601b3f642d0.png) ![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_8f2aab3631c6f5d2.png) ![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_a693be5f74a9936d.png)

**Icons/Images**

My initial thought on the icons was to use the help of font awesome for icons as they were perfect and had a good experience. Unfortunately, with the flip card game I wanted more interactive images and look more realistic. I believed this would be better impact and have a better affect overall for the user experience. I took various images from the web pages finding the perfect images for the game. To me and other users who have viewed the page and interactive and tested it they&#39;ve found the game overall image impressive and eye catching. This was the idea I was going for ensure the game works correct and is pleasant visually to the user.

**Content Section**

For the content the cards have been applied as required in a 4 by 4 grid for this mode. Keeping the main aspect of the game in the center of the screen for larger devices. For small devices this has been set to be viewed as 2 by 2. I believe this can be implemented to be improved in the future and something to work on to be 4 by 4. They will start with click to start message with the cards hidden. Once started the user will hear the music and clock will be begin to countdown. The cards will flip as required only two at a time as it checks the match. If its wrong cards flip back and the user goes again. The game title will be at the top of the screen with the font and colours provided. Followed by the clock and time, mute and unmute button and the flips which counts as the user clicks the cards. When the cards match the cards will stay on the screen visible of the item and will swing left to right to show they have been paired up correctly. If the user can&#39;t complete the game in time, they will get the Game over message including some sad music to show they have lost. The user can click again on the screen to try the game again. If all the cards match the user will get a Winner message on the screen and click to restart. Overall, I believe the game set up will be simple enough to understand be fun for the user.

**Wireframes**

I used Balsamiq frameworks for designing and planning my game this would be the way to influence my design and give me an idea how it would look from my ideas. If any changes are implemented then I can discuss the changes from the original idea and show how I&#39;ve improved the design.

The wireframes will show the design and the following images will show the design of the game and the outcome of the requested design. I will try and match the game to the wireframe and improve the project as I go. Providing information on how and why changes have been made on the project and the game. This will always be to the benefit of the design, layout and final outcome of the project work.

**Features**

## Existing Features

### Game Startup Modal

- The game loads with a screen prompting the user to get started. Since the game is timed, I wanted to give the user a screen that they could see the layout and controls immediately without starting the clock. So, the start click overlays the playing board to ensure the clock starts when the user is settled and ready to play, so they could maximize their chance of completing the game.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_445aa4784118fee2.png)

### Active Game Mode

The active game mode has the game title clock, sound control, flip counter and cards.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_31e829484de660ed.png)

- When a user clicks on a card, it animates as it flips over and the face value is displayed.
- When the user hovers over the image the dice enlarge and roll to the center of the card.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_25a997e877112095.png)

- When the user clicks and matches the images on the game the user will hear the flip sound and the cards will sway left to right.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_626daa746b419585.png)

- If the user gets the pairs wrong both cards will display for a very short period before spinning back to be hidden.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_9f8f779efbf17427.png)

- Below shows the mute button being included in the game. The image below with the speaker added and the vibrations indicates the sound is playing in the game at this moment.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_826e4cfd0615c33d.png)

- The below shows a speaker with and X this will indicate the sound has been muted in the game. The sounds images have been customer made by putting a square and rectangle together with a bendable line fore the sound vibrations. The x was made with a capital X included.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_72dc4488e8f39402.png)

**Game Over Modal**

- **There are two versions of the game over, loser and winner.**
- **The music is upbeat if the user if victorious.**
- **The music is doomed if the user fails to beat the clock.**
- **Both screens encourage the user to play another game**

**Features to Improve/Implement**

**1. Animation improvements**

The idea I had for the web page as an improvement after completing the webpage would be when the user matches a pair they could zoom or move towards the user&#39;s screen. They would enlarge and say pair. At the moment I didn&#39;t believe this was necessary but as a future improvement this could be an excellent idea. This could be with fireworks just enhance the users experience when they get a pair visually.

**2. Start Up Cards**

When the user starts the game, this could be the cards being for example shuffled on to the page. So, before the game starts for the user and the clock counts down the cards would be dealt out on to the screen. This would be a huge improvement when users start up. This would be a future in improvement due to the various actions required with the code and to get this 100% correct would be the main aspect. The cards would have to align perfectly on the screen.

**3. Game Title Lighting amends**

Due to the theme being casino and using bright lights behind the Lucky Casino text there could be a need for a lighting effect. This could be like a flashing light behind the text making it stand out more and be really appealing. I believe this would be a good feature and would need to be researched. Only concern would be for any people who have trouble with flashing lights as part of a health concern. I believe the users safety would be fair and foremost. A warning would be required if this was implemented to keep any users who suffer from this safe.

4. **Make Code easier to maintain**

I know I can use jQuery or vanilla JavaScript to dynamically build the HTML for the cards based on a json data object but I&#39;m very new to JavaScript at this point and after failed attempts (you ideally would check in something, uncheck it) I had to back it out so I could meet my deadlines for this project.

5. **Theme Swaps**

Theme is the upgrade option for the game. This would have to completed and reviewed and tested ensuring the themes can be swapped correctly and wouldn&#39;t have any code breaks. This would require through testing to ensure the user can flip between themes very easy if they wish to do without losing their current game. My overall target was to make sure the theme used (Casino Theme) would work correctly before implementing the theme enhancements in the game.

6. **Difficulty Levels**

Having different difficulties in the game would be an excellent addition to get users to test their skills on easier modes or harder modes. As this was not the aim of the game it was too ensure the game functions correctly and is visually attractive for the user to keep interested. This feature can be input once the game is working correctly 100%. The main function and goal is too ensure the game is working and working successfully.

## Scalable and Easy to Maintain Code

Call out that card\_data is now a json object so you can easily increase the number of cards to match if you chose to add a difficulty layer or change themes and buildCards loops through dynamically creating the playing field to make it making it easy to maintain reference the file this stuff is in by the directory path.

**Technologies used**

For the website the following programming languages have been used HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) – The project required and believed GitHub was the best for storing the projects details and easily be used for remote access when required.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - used to simplify some DOM manipulation for certain functions
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) – Great toll to be sued for the development of the website and using the platform to complete the website as required. This helped fulfil the potential to complete the website.
- Boostrap
- [www.dafont.com](http://www.dafont.com/)
- [Basalmiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/) - Used for wireframe creation using professional tools to support the design
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools) - Audit you used it for your accessibility testing
- [Favicon](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) - Used to provide unique logo for the web page icon section
- [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) - Color Scheme generator, used to fine tune color selection and find hover colors
- Markdown Table Generator - Used to help with documentation table formatting
- Markdown Table Of Contents Generator - Used to create table of contents

# Testing

## Validation Testing

I used the following websites and pasted my code into it to ensure the code had no syntax errors:

- **JavaScript -** [**https://jshint.com/**](https://jshint.com/)
- **HTML -** [**https://validator.w3.org/**](https://validator.w3.org/)
- **CSS -** [**https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- **Lighthouse -** [**https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm\_source=devtools**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools)

## User Stories Testing

### Automated

Jasmine testing would be ideal to test the card flipping accurately and accordingly. Also, the building of the card content was correctly working. Due to time constraints and working on the other aspects of the game I couldn&#39;t pursue the possible requirement.

### Manual

Manual testing was completed on the website/game features ensuring they work correctly for the users. The details have been provided below showing the result of the testing via two devices. The responsive device was fine when testing. Therefore, attempt testing on a small platform and a medium platform.

### Cross Browser Testing

Various browsers were tested with the game link to ensure it would work on the browsers selected and available to use.

## Lighthouse Audit

&quot;Identify and fix common problems that affect your sites performance, accessibility, and user experience.&quot;

Accessibility testing was conducted on the site to ensure it was suitable and performing to a suitable score for users and their experience on the website. This way the site can potentially work to its maximum performance. This is completed by selected the lighthouse option on the developer tool and generating a report for the selected device. This can be mobile or desktop devices.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_35bd7b1ecf9d9ed0.png)

The results for mobile are 98 which is a worthy score for a website but I would look to improve the score where posisble this can be a future update and performance improvement.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_e13b84570cc1f283.png)

The result for desktop was 100 which is acceptable for the website and performance. As mentioned in the mobile review improvement to be completed as a future improvement.

![](RackMultipart20200917-4-amq41k_html_ebfa2e7bab79b70c.png)

As you can see for both parts of the testing the accessibility is at 77 which isn&#39;t the best for that option and could do with improving. A few amends where completed and added the alt=&quot;card&quot; code to each code in the card.js section e.g. \&lt;img class=&quot;dice dice-bottom-right&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/dice.png&quot; alt=&quot;card&quot;\&gt;&#39;+ and \&lt;img class=&quot;chip&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/chip.png&quot; alt=&quot;card&quot;\&gt;&#39;+. This fixed both the mobile and desktop accessibility and upgrade all scores to a better standard. This is indicated on the two images below mobile accessibility improvement and desktop accessibility improvement.

### Bugs Discovered

| **Features** | **Description** | **Steps to Reproduce** | **Resolution** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Clock Countdown** | When the game starts the game appears to work correctly. I noticed the clock was counting down in a strange pattern. It went from 60 to 49 then back up to 59 and was counting down in a very strange pattern. Eventually the pattern would get down to zero but the code would be counting down correctly on the developer tool. The problem was the game wasn&#39;t counting down correct. This caused visual problems for the game. This was spotted after the testing was complete. (Indicated in image 1.a) | In the css code change the code
 h1 {
 font-family: casino;
 }

 and ensure casino is the select font and remove the code

 #time-remaining, #flips {
 font-family: arial, sans-serif;
 font-weight: bold;
 }.

 When the code loads you will see the clock will jump from 60 to 49 incorrectly | change the h1 text and input casino as this can be used for the clock and flips title. Add the following code into script.css insert the code by line 40

 #time-remaining, #flips {
 font-family: arial, sans-serif;
 font-weight: bold;
 }

 This change the integers into the san-serif text and we can use the casino text for the title clock and flips. |
| Accessibility Score | The accessibility score was quite low and the overall scores dropped down on the report generated. I completed some research and noticed when reviewing the code it was the alt=&quot;card&quot; attribute flagged errors on the css code reviewer. The information found and obtained confirmed the importance of the alt&quot;card&quot; as required code on the images uploaded or applied in the coding. | The code in the card.js in the function section. Example the code with the image src e.g. src=&quot;assets/images/dice.png&quot; alt=&quot;card&quot;\&gt;&#39;+ remove the &quot; alt=&quot;card&quot;. This will show when you open the developer tool on the games webpage by pressing F12, select Lighthouse then generate the report It will show a low accessibility score. | Add the alt=&quot;card&quot; after the image source details to ensure the accessibility is high for users and were following correct guidelines for every user when completing the coding on the website. |
| Card Flipping Background Colour | When flipping the cards in the game. There was an issue with the background colour of the cards spinning. The background of the card in the flipping process would have a white background. This was not only presented incorrectly but was required to be fixed as it didn&#39;t look right for the game. | The .card elements is required ot have no background colour provided. As a result this is defaulted to an white background in the game. The white background is only applied to the cards in the game. It will display while flipping and disappear once the card has fully flipped. | The accessibility score was quite low and the overall scores dropped down on the report generated. I completed some research and noticed when reviewing the code it was the alt=&quot;card&quot; attribute flagged errors on the css code reviewer. The information found and obtained confirmed the importance of the alt&quot;card&quot; as required code on the images uploaded or applied in the coding. |
| Muting Issues | The muting feature in the game wasn&#39;t working correctly when the game was playing the background sound would mute. Although this worked correctly the flip sound, game loss and game victory sound were still working. | Class audioController section of the code in the script.js there the various elements for the sounds ensure the code reads the below. e.g.
flip() {this.flipsound.play();}
When the card is flipped it will make the flip sound in the game when the mute button is pressed. | To fix the issue faced with muting the sound fully the code was amended and the code should read.
flip() {if(!this.muted){.flipsound.play();}}
When this is set the code will mute the flip sound this was applied to all the sounds so the game wouldn&#39;t play any sounds at all.

| Shuffling Issue | When attempting to create the set up for the cards using bootstrap method with cols and rows. The error would occur where the cards would only shuffle the cards assigned in that row. | In the code where the cards where originally built in html each card was typed and each of them had their own div section. They would be required to be rebuilt individually and applied to the code. | Instead of using the cards individually a wrapper was used and the cards where built in the card.js section. The function was created to create the cards so all the dice in the correct area of the card and all the images are loaded into the game. This was a excellent fix as it would be easier to amend and expand the game if necessary. |

### Outstanding Defects

A minor issue with sound was when the game is muted and restarts the sound plays in the game. This bug will need more time to be fixed due to the late discovery. If the user mutes the music twice it fixes the issue but unknown reason if the code is muted it should play the sound. This needs more investigation to resolve the issue.

### Usability Testing

List people you had review your code from the peer to peer channel or direct messages Maybe state age, occupation and any suggestions they gave you that you implemented.
